      "Question": "What makes Wordle so popular?",
      "Answer": "Wordle has taken over the internet. The game’s rules are simple, and the best part is that when you guess the correct word, you can share it on your social media channels. Surprisingly, when shared, it only displays the journey as a series of Grey, Yellow and Green boxes rather than the correct word. Furthermore, all of the other players are working on the same puzzle, which is a great way to strike up a conversation or brag about your accomplishment on your social media handle. More importantly, you can only play one puzzle per day, which means you only have one chance to guess the correct word on the given day.",

      "Question": "Is there anything else I should know in wordle?",
      "Answer": "You can toggle between a high contrast “color blind” version and a dark mode by clicking the gear next to the word wordle in the upper right corner. If you are feeling very lucky, you can switch to “Hard Mode” which forces you to include any hints in the next word. For example, in hard mode, I would have to add the S, T and E in my third guess in the first screenshot (so STORE wouldn’t have worked).",

      "Question": "What are these squares that everyone on Twitter is sharing?",
      "Answer": "Wordle did not intend for the game to have a sharing component, but after seeing users on Twitter sharing their results with Green, Yellow and Grey square emojis, he added a share button that allows you to copy your results once you have completed the game in a way that doesn’t reveal the day’s word to anyone who has not played it yet. So as you can see in the grid below, I guessed absolutely incorrectly on the first entry, got two correct letters in the right positions on the second chance, and accurately predicted the word on the third effort (not bad).",

These letter combinations can be discovered at either the beginning or the end of the wordle, so if the letter ‘Ch’ are highlighted in Yellow, look in a different region of the wordle.",

Yes, this appears to be self-evident. However, trying to coming up with five-letter words that don’t use letters you’ve already attempted can take some time and effort.",

This is one of the few online fads that is worldwide, educational and free. During the pandemic a couple in New York (Josh Wardle and Palak shah) invented a word game. It became the first viral gaming fad of the year for word game fans after taking off on the social media in 2021.

      "Answer": "Because Wordle is a five-letter word, you can only use five different alphabets. The remaining 21 letters will be greyed out, indicating that the Wordle Solver should not use them for generating possible response solutions. For inserting grey letters, Wordle Solver provides ten spaces. You can use the PLUS symbol to add an additional row of letters to fill in.",

      "Question": "What if I enter a green letter in the wrong box?",
      "Answer": "If you enter a green letter in the wrong box then Wordle Solver won't be able to help you solve the Wordle for the day. This is because, by entering a letter at the wrong spot you are telling Wordle Solver that this spot has the letter, which is not the actual case. Therefore Wordle Solver cannot find the right word.

      "Question": "Do I have to enter the yellow letters in the exact same spot?",
      "Answer": "Yellow letters in Wordle mean that the letters are in the word but not at the correct spot.

Therefore, you can enter the yellow words anywhere you like in the space provided.",

      "Answer": "This could be because you entered wrong information. Wordle Solver will not be able to assist you in solving the Wordle for the day if you enter a green letter in the incorrect box. This is because by entering a letter in the incorrect location, you are informing Wordle Solver that this location contains the letter, which is not the case.
