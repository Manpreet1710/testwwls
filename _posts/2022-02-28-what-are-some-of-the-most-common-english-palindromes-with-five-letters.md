## **What is Palindromes?**

The word “palindrome” arrives from the Greek word “palindromos,” which is a blend of two Greek words: “palin,” which implies “back” or “again,” along with “dromos” suggesting “route” or “road.” These Palindromes have lived for centuries: an acrostic named Sator Square, dates around to 79 AD and newly emerged as a plot point in Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s 2020 movie. Most recent palindromes emerged in Greek or Latin, and the great poet John Taylor wrote the first English-language palindrome—

**_“Lewd did I live & evil did I dwell”—in 1614._**

In the subsequent centuries, palindromes grew in popularity, with more later by 1971, the Guinness Book of World Records started to officially acknowledge the world's most protracted palindromes.

And the words that spell with some another of the word back, like “live” evolving to become “evil”? That’s named a semordnilap, which occurs to be a semordnilap of the palindrome.

There are numerous types of palindromes, which can affect numbers, dates, names, and also soulful music. Many palindromes are amusing, such as “Straw? No, overly stupid a fad;

I put soot on warts.”
