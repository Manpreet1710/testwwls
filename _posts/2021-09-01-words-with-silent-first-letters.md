60% of the words in the English language have a silent letter. The English language contains only 26 alphabets and has been influenced by other languages like French and Latin. Therefore it can be a hard language to learn especially if you are not a native/bilingual English speaker.

### **Basic rules for silent letters**

**Silent B**

In words that end with the suffix "mb", b becomes silent. For example, in words like comb and numb, where b comes after m at the end of a sentence it becomes silent. So the pronunciation of the word comb is "com".

In root words i.e., words that are in their original form and no prefixes and suffixes have been added to them, b is not pronounced if it comes before t. For example, words like debt, doubt and subtle are pronounced as "det", "da-out" and "su- tle", respectively.

C is not pronounced in the SC combination, or when it comes before K or Q in a word. Some examples are Muscle, Ascent, Fascinate, Acknowledge, Acquit, etc. Although there are some exceptions such as Sclera, and Sceptic.

D is not pronounced when it comes before G in a word, like Pledge, Hedge, etc. Some popular words with silent D are, Handsome, Sandwich, Wednesday.

**Silent G**

With some exceptions, G is silent before N. Some examples are Sign, Feign, Align. The exceptions include, Magnet, Cognitive. The combination GH is silent when it follows a vowel. For example, Sigh, Weight, Might, Daughter etc. When two complete words are combined, this rule becomes redundant. For example, Doghouse, Bighead, etc.

H is silent when preceded by W. When, Why, Whether, are some examples of this. H is also silent at the beginning of many words like Hour, Heir, Honest. H is also silent when it comes after the letters C, G, or R. Example, Choir, Ghoul, Rhythm.

With some exceptions, L is silent after the vowels A, O and U. For example, Calm, Should, Folk. The exceptions include Halo, Sulk, Bulk. hold.

In words where S comes before L, S is silent. Example Island, Aisle, Isle.
