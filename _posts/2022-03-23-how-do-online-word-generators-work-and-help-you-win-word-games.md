**BUT HOW DOES A WORD GENERATOR REALLY WORKS?**

  
The fundamental function of a word generator is to decipher words from assembled letters. For starters, select a word generator tool that you find the best for yourself. Test different sites, check all the features, and then choose but remember to keep them open while playing. You must just merely enter the scrambled letters that you wish to unravel in the input field. The letters can be anything from vowels to consonants. Press the generate button and voila you’ve got the ultimate word list for your game night. You can also select the beginning and end letters of a word on some websites, and this even helps you in suffix and prefix exchanges. So, now you don’t need to worry about losing the game with your friends.

Now, let’s talk about the top features in word generators:

* The best feature about the word generators may be the fact that they provide you with the highest-scoring words for your game. Working with this feature is of great benefit when you want to top the game.


* You can use the advanced search feature of some sites where you can specify the start and end letters of the word.
* My favorite feature for a word generator is that you can select on the site which word game you are playing and want the results for. To tell the truth, it's my favorite tool to cheat during games with family or friends.
* Additionally, there is a feature where you can choose between UK and US versions, as both the countries have different ways of pronouncing and spelling some words.
* Furthermore, there is a unique feature in some of the word makers where you can decide the length of the word with added ease.
* On some sites, you can even save a list of already searched words for future plays. It acts as a perfect cheat sheet.
* There is also a feature about wildcard word options on some sites. Where any random words are being provided to you.
