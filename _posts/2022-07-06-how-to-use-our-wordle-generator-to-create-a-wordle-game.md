**Wordle generator: What is it?**

Wordle, a delightfully straightforward web-based word guessing game, has captivated the internet's attention over the past two months amid hype cycles around web3 and the metaverse.

A wordle is just a picture of words, with the size of each word corresponding to how frequently it appears. The game doesn't need much of an introduction. The New York Times Company currently owns and publishes Wordle, a website-based word game founded and developed by Welsh software programmer Josh Wardle. A five-letter word can be guessed six times, with colored tiles offering feedback for each guess when letters match or are in the right place.

You cannot log in and may only play once a day; the interface and gamification are rudimentary. This is how it operates: A 5-by-6-inch grid of blank, white boxes greets you when you open the Wordle website. You must guess the solution by typing a five-letter word and clicking Enter because each box can only store one letter.

Any five-letter word will do as a first guess because there are no suggestions. The Wordle game officially starts there. The color of each letter's box changes when you send a guess.

• If it becomes green, you've correctly positioned the letter and it is present in the daily word.

• If the box turns yellow, the letter is present in the word but in the wrong place.

• If the box goes grey, the letter is not at all present in the word.

Internet visitors are welcomed each day with a brand-new word puzzle that can only be finished — or not — by paying attention to a sequence of process-of-elimination hints. Since Wordle's launch in the middle of December 2021, it has amassed millions of players who have shared their creations on Twitter and other social media sites.

If you've been using Wordle for a time, you may be familiar with this drive to further your Wordleing endeavors. In other words, you might want to mix things up by making your Wordle in addition to the official daily Wordle challenges.
