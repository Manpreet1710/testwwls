A tricky riddle that asks to name an English word with 3 consecutive double letters. You think about it and not get the answer because, well it's tricky. The answer is Woollen (double-u is the trick here). But, this won't give you extra points in a scrabble game. Below are actual words with three consecutive double letters.

We included proper nouns (mainly place names), some foreign words, and a few of the best-invented terms in this list of words with consecutive double letters, in addition to dictionary words and words discovered in Internet publications. A list of personal names has been compiled, but only if there are several cases.

A more thorough search would very certainly turn up a significant number of more names, although verification is often difficult. Thanks to Dave Morice for the inspiration from his Kickshaws storey "The Moonbookkeeper and the Toollooter" (Word Ways, May 1999)
