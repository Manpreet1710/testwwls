List down the high scoring 5 letter words that have no repeating letters. Where do we find these words. Explain some tools and their features.

Where we come up with these words. A unique way to solve a word intrigued me. The idea is to select 5 words with separate letters so that you will be left with 25 characters. A set of words is suggested (all of the words are valid English words):

* brick
* glent
* jumpy
* vozhd
* waqfs

The first thought I had was:

* Begin with the first word.
* Minimize overlapping words in the word list.
* Select the remaining word from the word list.
* Repeat this word.

But it doesn't really work unless you have a set of five separate words in order.

For the following list:

* brick
* feast
* glent
* jumpy
* vozhd
* waqfs

I will end up with: \[brick, feast, jumpy, vozhd\] because feast comes before gland and will filter it out, but in the end, glent would have been the better pick.

I have not been able to find algorithms for this particular problem, so I wondered if there is an existing algorithm that can be applied to them.

Were you aware that there is a term for words without repetitive letters? A heterogram is a word, sentence or sentence in which no letter of the alphabet appears more than once (from straight-, meaning "different", + -gram, denoting "written"). The words isogram and non-pattern are also terms that have been used to describe the same thing. Therefore, fundamentally, a heterogram is a word with all single letters. How cool is it?

Here are a few words of 5 letters without repetitive letters to help you prepare for your next pun. So, without further delay, let's get into the answers to the most frequently asked questions about this, which will help you win (or perhaps cheat in) your next game. Is?
