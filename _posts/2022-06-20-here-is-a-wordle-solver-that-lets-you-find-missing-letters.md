**What is Wordle?**

Wordle is an online game where players submit words of five letters or more that they think best match a daily theme which can be things like animals, places, and culture. Before guessing the word for the day, players are allowed to use up to six chances to make guesses throughout the day at any given moment.

After successfully guessing the word players will be awarded points based on how many letters were in their correct position, how closely they matched the wordâ€™s appearance, and whether they found it before other players! each day a new word is released, so what to do before submitting the score?

Here is some advice: when you try to deduce the letters in the correct places and the letters are still yellow or green, you can make a small change in your 100% good word. You will have limited attempts each day so use them wisely! If you think you have it - no matter how much time is left - submit immediately! It is important to be accurate when you guess so make sure to look out for those green tiles!

Wordle has become a daily ritual for its users all over the world. The word game, launched in 2021, quickly became a viral trend, and the craze surrounding the puzzle has not subsided.

Wordle is a simple game to win once you get to know about the tricks and tips. Let us start with the fundamentals of Wordle.

1. Wordle's goal is to guess the correct five-letter word, so start by entering any word containing five letters and looking at the results.
2. Individual letters will be color-coded after you enter your first word. Green indicates that the letter and position are correct, yellow indicates that the letter is correct but the position is not, and grey indicates that the letter is not in the five-letter word.
3. Continue guessing five-letter words while keeping the colors in mind. But be careful; you only have six guesses to get the right five-letter word!
4. Congratulations on correctly guessing the correct word. If you do not get it right on the first try, the word will be revealed after the sixth guess.
