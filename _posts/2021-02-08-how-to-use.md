2. Total the Score for that Word
3. Draw Tiles to Replace the Tiles Played

The principal player should play their first word on the middle square of the board, the detect that has a 'star' on it. All words should be at least two letters in length. Words are played either vertically or on a level plane. Corner to corner wordplay isn't allowed.
