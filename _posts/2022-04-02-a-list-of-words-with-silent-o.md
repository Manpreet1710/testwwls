# **A List of Words with Silent O**

## **What is a silent letter?**

A silent letter in an alphabetical system of writing is a letter that in a word doesn't really match any sound in the word's pronunciation. A silent letter is typically represented with the null sign U+2205 EMPTY SET, in linguistics. A null segment is one that is unpronounced or unwritten. The symbol is similar to the Scandinavian letter as well as other symbols.

The significant number of silent letters is one of the notable characteristics of English spelling. Edward Carney differentiates between distinct types of "silent" letters, each of which presents readers with varying degrees of difficulty. The presence of many different silent letters is one of the most difficult features of English spelling and pronunciation.

Since English has developed from a variety of sources (Latin, Greek, French, German, Old English, and so on), it has had to absorb all of its predecessors' spelling and pronunciation oddities. As a result, there have been numerous cases where specific letters have become silent. While it may appear that silent letters have no function in a word, this is not entirely true: silent letters can assist to separate two otherwise homophonous words, convey the meaning or origin of a word, or even aid in determining the overall sound of a word.

## **What is English Orthography?**

The system of writing rules used to represent spoken English in written form is known as English orthography, and it allows readers to link the symbols to sound and interpretation. It covers spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation in English.

English spelling, like that of most other world languages, has a high level of standardization. When movable type was introduced to England in the late 15th century, this standardization began to emerge. Unlike other languages, however, practically every phoneme (sound) can be spelled in various ways, and most letters have multiple pronunciations depending on their position in a word and context.

## **What is a silent O?**

Whenever the letter O is silent in words, the letter is known as silent O. However, silent O is not a very common occurrence in the English language.

There is an obvious overabundance of letters in enough, rough, and harsh, where o is one of those who have no purpose there. Then there's the word colonel, in whom neither o acts correctly and the 2nd o does not really bother to try. In contrast to those, we have jeopardy, leopard, and humans.

Example- chocolate, sophomore, Catholic
