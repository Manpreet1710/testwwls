**Interesting Facts About Scrabble**

**History**

![](/uploads/alfred-1.jpg)

Scrabble is an interesting word game involving two or four players.The players earn points by putting tiles on a game board divided into a 15-15 grid of squares, each carrying a single letter.. These tiles must form words that could read from left to right or from right to left and be included in any standard dictionary or lexicon. This name Scrabble is a trademark of Mattel in most of the world, except the USA and Canada where it is a trademark of Hasbro. This game is quite famous as it is sold worldwide in over 120 countries in different languages. Roughly one-third of American homes have this game. This game was designed in 1938 by Alfred Mosher Butts who was an American architect. Butts was born on April 13, 1899, in New York and breathed his last on April 4, 1993, in Rhinebeck. In the early 1930s after spending a considerable tenure as a successful architect, Butts set out to develop this board game when he was unemployed. At the time, he closely studied the various games available and noticed that existing games fell into three categories: multiple games such as dice and bingo, moving games such as checks and checkers, and anagrams-like word games.

There is a street sign at 35th Avenue and 81st Street in Jackson Heights that is stylized to memorialize Butts’ invention. Butts came up with a brilliant idea to built a game that would use the skills of combining elements of puzzles and anagrams. Initially, this game was named Lexico and later this was changed into Criss Cross Words. This famous game got trademarked in 1948 by one James Burnot and his wife. This couple turned an abandoned schoolhouse into a Scrabble factory. Butts had also invented another game called ‘Alfred’s other game’ but this game did not gain as much publicity as Scrabble.

In an English-language set, the game has 100 tiles, 98 of which are labeled with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10. The number of points for each lettered tile depends on the frequency of the letter in standard English, with commonly used letters such as vowels being worth one point, while less common letters rank higher with Q and Z values of 10 points each. The game also has two blank tiles. Q is considered the most problematic letter, since almost all words contain U with it also, in other languages such as French, Dutch, Italian, and German, a similar problem occurs. Due to its low frequency and a lack of words that have it at the end, J is also hard to play.

In 1984, Scrabble was turned into a daytime game show on NBC. This show ran from July 1984 to March 1990. The second season of this show was aired from January to June 1993. In 2004, Scrabble was also named to the National Toy Hall of Fame. The National Toy Hall of Fame is an American hall of fame that acknowledges the contributions that have gained popularity over the years from toys or games. Icon status, longevity, discovery, and innovation are the criteria for inclusion in the list. Overall seventy-two games are included in the famous list in the Hall of Fame.

**1.Scrabble as a tournament game**

Scrabble is also played worldwide as a tournament game with a game clock and set of time control. Although casual games are played at the relaxation of time, this is not the case for competitive games. Almost all tournament games typically involve the players where each one has 25 minutes to finish the game. Players are allowed "tracking sheets", pre-printed with the letters in the initial pool, from which tiles can be crossed off as they are played. Tracking tiles is an important strategy in this game, especially during the endgame. An introduction to how to play professional Scrabble game can be found in Stefan Fatsis’ book “[Word Freak](https://www.amazon.in/Word-Freak-Heartbreak-Obsession-Competitive/dp/0142002267)”. In his process of compiling this book, Fatsi himself became a highly rated player. In the World Scrabble Championship held in 2019, the two finalists were New Zealander Nigel Richards and Australian poker player and real estate agent David Eldar. Nigel born in 1967 and Elfdar born in 1990, both were former world champions Richards won the world championship in 2007, 2011, and 2013, and was also the defending champion while Eldar clinched the title in 2017. Richards triumphed 3-1.
