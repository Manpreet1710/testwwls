You have seen your colleague frantically searching upwards of 5-letter words on his phone or even sharing on social media without any context? If that's the case, they're likely obsessed with a rather popular new game: Wordle. Wordle is a great game that has taken the internet by storm.

Wordle is a word game that became popular in 2022 and is still gaining popularity. With 300,000 players reported at the beginning of January, it has proven to be one of the most popular games. There are more than 2 million users of Wordle worldwide.

The name of the game may be simple, but many people are looking up what Wordle exactly is and how to play it at this very moment. Many are still learning about it, and if you are also learning then do not worry because we will teach you all you need to know before starting this fun and addictive game!

Wordle is a word game without any specific rules. You might have seen those tiny red, amber, and green tiles shared on the group chat or poster on social media or even wondered what they could be.

Well, Wordle is a puzzle game that many people enjoy playing while they are at work on their break as it can help relieve stress, or even be a fun car road trip game for the whole family.

**What is Wordle? How to play it?**

Wordle is a free online word-guessing game in which players must guess a five-letter word in six attempts or less.

Let us have a look at how the game works

• If the letter in your guess does not match the target word, it will turn gray.

• If your guess is in the word but not in the correct position, the letter will turn yellow.

• If the letter is in the word and the correct place, it will turn a bright green color.

• You have six tries to solve the puzzle, and based on Twitter feedback, it is fun, challenging, and addictive.

Players use the virtual keyboard to enter letters from the alphabet into the five blank tiles. They press the submit button once satisfied with their 5-letter word guess. This then validates the word and informs you whether your word or some of the letters are correct. If everything is correct, all five letters turn green. You win the game if you correctly guess the word on the first six attempts. If you win two days in a row or more, you will be awarded a winning streak. This will continue until you miss the word one day and the streak is broken.

**Wordle Tips and Tricks**

**What is the best strategy to play it?**

1\. There is nothing more important than your Wordle start word.

2\. Pick two very different words for the first two lines.

3\. Use your guessing stats to inform your strategy.

4\. Watch out for letters that might show up more than once.

5\. Go old school and break out a pen and paper.

6\. Your streak is more important than your score - so protect it.

7\. Hard mode is an annoying mode.

8\. Play your vowels early.

9\. Play common consonants early.

10\. Think about combinations.

11\. Think about the positioning of the letters.

12\. Take your time.

13\. Avoid reusing letters that come before you.

14\. Carefully pick your first five-letter word.

15\. Use a **wordle solver**.

**Who invented the game, how it has gained popularity, and what are the best starter words?**

Josh Wardle, a former employee of the social news website Reddit, created Wordle.

It became popular. After all, there is only one puzzle per day, which generates a sense of scarcity and competition because everyone plays the same puzzle. You can compete with your Wordle friends on Twitter to solve the daily puzzle. It is also simple and enjoyable to share your results, as you can post an image of your Wordle showcasing your word-solving abilities without revealing the answer.

According to multiple sources on the internet, the best Wordle starter words are:

1\. ADIEU

2\. TEARS

3\. LARES
