<p>As per scrabble rules, there are three fundamental strides to a turn:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Play a Word</li>
  <li>Total the Score for that Word</li>
  <li>Draw Tiles to Replace the Tiles Played</li>
</ol>

<p>The principal player should play their first word on the middle square of the board, the detect that has a ‘star’ on it. All words should be at least two letters in length. Words are played either vertically or on a level plane. Corner to corner wordplay isn’t allowed.</p>

<p>Play consistently moves clockwise (to one side). Every player should play off of words effectively present on the board.

No tile can be moved or moved whenever it is played (uncovering a fruitful test).</p>

<p>At whatever point a word is played, different players may challenge the word in the event that they don’t trust it is a genuine word or it is spelled wrong.
