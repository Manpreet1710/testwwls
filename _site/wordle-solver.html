Surprisingly, when shared, it only displays the journey as a series of Grey, Yellow and Green boxes rather than the correct word. Furthermore, all of the other players are working on the same puzzle, which is a great way to strike up a conversation or brag about your accomplishment on your social media handle. More importantly, you can only play one puzzle per day, which means you only have one chance to guess the correct word on the given day."

If you are feeling very lucky, you can switch to “Hard Mode” which forces you to include any hints in the next word. For example, in hard mode, I would have to add the S, T and E in my third guess in the first screenshot (so STORE wouldn’t have worked)."

So as you can see in the grid below, I guessed absolutely incorrectly on the first entry, got two correct letters in the right positions on the second chance, and accurately predicted the word on the third effort (not bad)."

1)The object of the game is to guess the correct five – letter word. To begin, type in any five - letter word and see what appears.

2)When you type your first word, the letters will be color coded. Green indicates that the letter and position are accurate, Yellow indicates that the letter is correct but the position is incorrect and Grey indicates that the letter is not in the five - letter word.

3)Continue guessing five letter words, you only have six guesses to get the correct five letter term

4)Finally, if you correctly guess the word, congratulations: you’ve won the game

This is how the wordle game works."

                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">What makes Wordle so popular?</h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">Wordle has taken over the internet. The game’s rules are simple, and the best part is that when you guess the correct word, you can share it on your social media channels. Surprisingly, when shared, it only displays the journey as a series of Grey, Yellow and Green boxes rather than the correct word. Furthermore, all of the other players are working on the same puzzle, which is a great way to strike up a conversation or brag about your accomplishment on your social media handle. More importantly, you can only play one puzzle per day, which means you only have one chance to guess the correct word on the given day.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto pt-5">
                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">Is there anything else I should know in wordle?</h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">You can toggle between a high contrast “color blind” version and a dark mode by clicking the gear next to the word wordle in the upper right corner. If you are feeling very lucky, you can switch to “Hard Mode” which forces you to include any hints in the next word. For example, in hard mode, I would have to add the S, T and E in my third guess in the first screenshot (so STORE wouldn’t have worked).</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto pt-5">
                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">What are these squares that everyone on Twitter is sharing?</h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">Wordle did not intend for the game to have a sharing component, but after seeing users on Twitter sharing their results with Green, Yellow and Grey square emojis, he added a share button that allows you to copy your results once you have completed the game in a way that doesn’t reveal the day’s word to anyone who has not played it yet. So as you can see in the grid below, I guessed absolutely incorrectly on the first entry, got two correct letters in the right positions on the second chance, and accurately predicted the word on the third effort (not bad).</p>

                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">What is the best way to try hard mode?</h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">To try ‘Hard’ mode, go to the top-right corner and click the “settings” button. When you reveal a letter in a Green location in hard mode, you must use a term that contains that letter in the same spot for future guesses.</p>

                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">Words featuring diagraphs, such as ‘Ch’, ‘Sh’ and ‘St’ can also help you eliminate wrong letters, limiting your word choices. These letter combinations can be discovered at either the beginning or the end of the wordle, so if the letter ‘Ch’ are highlighted in Yellow, look in a different region of the wordle.</p>

                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">At the bottom of the wordle board is a keypad that reveals which letters are Green, Yellow and Gray. Reusing letters that have turned gray is not a good idea. Yes, this appears to be self-evident. However, trying to coming up with five-letter words that don’t use letters you’ve already attempted can take some time and effort.</p>

                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">Using words that cover the entire alphabet while avoiding repeats of other letters is the secret to improving at wordle. It's best to choose a few that cover all of the vowels as well as the most common consonants. Beginning with any of these letters should lead to more clues earlier in the game.</p>

1)The object of the game is to guess the correct five – letter word. To begin, type in any five - letter word and see what appears.

2)When you type your first word, the letters will be color coded. Green indicates that the letter and position are accurate, Yellow indicates that the letter is correct but the position is incorrect and Grey indicates that the letter is not in the five - letter word.

3)Continue guessing five letter words, you only have six guesses to get the correct five letter term

4)Finally, if you correctly guess the word, congratulations: you’ve won the game

This is how the wordle game works.</p>

                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">What Is Wordle?</h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">Wordle is a simple online word game in which players must find a five-letter word in six guesses, with a new problem presented each day. This is one of the few online fads that is worldwide, educational and free. During the pandemic a couple in New York (Josh Wardle and Palak shah) invented a word game. It became the first viral gaming fad of the year for word game fans after taking off on the social media in 2021. A slew of five letter word puzzles may be found all over the place (posting the winning word).</p>

                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">How to add more grey letters? </h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">Because Wordle is a five-letter word, you can only use five different alphabets. The remaining 21 letters will be greyed out, indicating that the Wordle Solver should not use them for generating possible response solutions. For inserting grey letters, Wordle Solver provides ten spaces. You can use the PLUS symbol to add an additional row of letters to fill in.</p>

                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">What if I enter a green letter in the wrong box?</h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">If you enter a green letter in the wrong box then Wordle Solver won't be able to help you solve the Wordle for the day. This is because, by entering a letter at the wrong spot you are telling Wordle Solver that this spot has the letter, which is not the actual case. Therefore Wordle Solver cannot find the right word. Make sure you enter the green letter at the correct spot.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">Do I have to enter the yellow letters in the exact same spot?</h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">Yellow letters in Wordle mean that the letters are in the word but not at the correct spot. So for Wordle Solver, it is enough to know the letter that exists in the word, and it will find you the word accordingly. Therefore, you can enter the yellow words anywhere you like in the space provided.</p>

                <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto pt-5">
                    <h3 class="meduim-text2 text-center mb-2">Wordle Solver did not help me find the answer. Why?</h2>
                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">This could be because you entered wrong information. Wordle Solver will not be able to assist you in solving the Wordle for the day if you enter a green letter in the incorrect box. This is because by entering a letter in the incorrect location, you are informing Wordle Solver that this location contains the letter, which is not the case. As a result, Wordle Solver is unable to locate the correct word. Make sure the green letter is in the right place.</p>

                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">Since Wordle is a 5 letter word, at max you can have 5 different alphabets. The remaining 21 letters would appear in gray and will tell the Wordle Solver not to use them while giving probable answer solutions. Wordle Solver provides 10 spaces for entering gray letters. You can click on the PLUS icon to add another row of letters that you can fill in.</p>

                        <p class="meduim-text text-center mb-0">When solving Wordle, the letters entered in the correct spot appear in Green color. For using Wordle Solver you need to enter the correctly entered letters in the boxes, AT THE CORRECT SPOT and then the Wordle Solver will give you the words that can be formed by the letters.</p>
